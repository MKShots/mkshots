## Hi there 👋 I'm Meeth – Data Wizard in Progress 🧙🏼‍♂️

I’m a former financial analyst turned data scientist, with a sharp eye for patterns and a soft spot for tech that makes life smarter. I’m pursuing my Master’s while working on real-world machine learning projects that blend intuition, analytics and engineering. My work blends business understanding with technical expertise to drive insights and impact. All of this is powered by my ADHD.

### 🚀 Highlight Projects

- 📷 [**Terrain Image Classification (Intel Dataset)**](link-to-repo)  
  Built and compared CNN, ResNet50, and EfficientNet architectures for classifying real-world terrain types. Preprocessing, model tuning, and evaluation — the whole shebang.

- 🧾 [**Financial Risk Predictor – XGBoost + SHAP**](link-to-repo)  
  Developed an end-to-end risk analysis pipeline using banking datasets, interpretable ML, and visual dashboards for stakeholder clarity.

- 🗣️ [**Sentiment Classifier – BERT + NLP**](link-to-repo)  
  Applied transfer learning to classify tweet sentiments with fine-tuned BERT embeddings and ML pipelines.

- ⚙️ [**ETL Pipeline for Sales Data** *(WIP)*](link-to-repo)  
  Working on a reusable ETL framework with `pandas`, `Airflow`, and `dbt` for scalable data workflows.
